# KerBalloons

#### Description

Designed to gather more scientific data in a more controlled fashion than a sounding rocket, Kerballoons are compact, light and can easily be packed with a probe and sent to any planet with an atmosphere. When coupled with the Kerbal Weather Project mod, KerBalloons can emulate real-world weather balloons by collecting in-situ atmospheric data on Kerbin.
