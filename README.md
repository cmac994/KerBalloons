# KerBalloons

## This mod is superseded by an up to date and improved version of [KerBalloons](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/199372-18-19-110-kerballoons-reinflated-real-science-beta/) available [here](https://github.com/linuxgurugamer/KerballoonsReinflated).

#### Description

Designed to gather more scientific data in a more controlled fashion than a sounding rocket, Kerballoons are compact, light and can easily be packed with a probe and sent to any planet with an atmosphere. When coupled with [Kerbal Weather Project](https://github.com/cmac994/KerbalWeatherProject), KerBalloons can emulate real-world [weather balloons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_balloon) by collecting in-situ atmospheric data on Kerbin.

KerBalloons was updated to work with KSP 1.11 by updating assembly references and recompiling in Visual Studio.
